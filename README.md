# Multi-Stage-Amplifier

**Specifications**

• Power supply: **+10V relative to the ground**;

• Current drawn from power supply: **less than 10 mA**;

• No-load voltage gain (at 1 𝑘𝐻𝑧): **|Avo| = 55**;

• Maximum no-load output voltage swing (at 1 𝑘𝐻𝑧): **8V peak to peak**;

• Loaded voltage gain (at 1 𝑘𝐻𝑧 and with 𝑅𝐿 = 1 𝑘Ω): **no smaller than 90% of the no-load voltage gain**;

• Maximum loaded output voltage swing (at 1 𝑘𝐻𝑧 and 𝑅𝐿 = 1 𝑘Ω): **4 V peak to peak**;

• Input resistance (at 1 𝑘𝑘𝐻𝐻𝑧𝑧): **around 3000 kΩ**;

• Amplifier type: non-inverting;

• Frequency response: **20 Hz to 50 kHz (−3db response)**;

• Type of transistors: **2 common emitters and 1 common collector**;

**Notes:**
• The output voltage is free from distortions (clipping, etc.) for 80mVpk-pk with load and 160mVpk-pk without load.
