# Multi-Stage-Amplifier

**Specifications**
• Power supply: **+10V relative to the ground**;
• Current drawn from power supply: **less than 10 mA**;
• No-load voltage gain (at 1 𝑘𝐻𝑧): **|𝑨𝒗o| = 55**;
• Maximum no-load output voltage swing (at 1 𝑘𝐻𝑧): **8V peak to peak**;
• Loaded voltage gain (at 1 𝑘𝐻𝑧 and with 𝑅𝐿 = 1 𝑘Ω): **no smaller than 𝟗𝟎% of the no-load voltage gain**;
• Maximum loaded output voltage swing (at 1 𝑘𝐻𝑧 and 𝑅𝐿 = 1 𝑘Ω): **4 V peak to peak**;
• Input resistance (at 1 𝑘𝑘𝐻𝐻𝑧𝑧): **around 30𝟎𝟎 𝒌Ω**;
• Amplifier type: inverting or non-inverting;
• Frequency response: **20 Hz to 50 kHz (−𝟑𝒅𝑩 response)**;
• Type of transistors: **2 common emitters and 1 common collector**;

**Notes:**
• The output voltage is free from distortions (clipping, etc.) for 80mVpk-pk with load and 160mVpk-pk with load and without load.
